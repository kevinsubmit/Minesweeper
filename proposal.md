# Project Proposal

## Project Choice 

- [ ] Minesweeper

## Project Description 

My app is called Minesweeper. It's a game app for players who want to play Minesweeper online. Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game often found on computers. The objective is to clear a rectangular grid filled with hidden mines without detonating any of them. Players uncover squares one at a time; if they reveal a mine, the game ends. However, if they uncover a safe square, a number will appear, indicating how many mines are adjacent to that square. This information helps players deduce the locations of the mines.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- Implement a grid where players can click to reveal squares.
- Include mine placement logic to randomly distribute mines.
- Display numbers in revealed squares to indicate the count of adjacent mines.
- End the game if a player clicks on a mine, displaying all mines and a game-over message.
- Automatically reveal adjacent squares when a square with zero adjacent mines is clicked.
- Determine a win condition when all safe squares are revealed, excluding mines.
User Interface.
- Create a simple and intuitive UI for interacting with the game.\*\*

#### Stretch Goals

- Offer at least two difficulty settings (e.g.,easy,medium,hard) with varying grid sizes and mine counts!
- Provide an option to restart the game easily.
